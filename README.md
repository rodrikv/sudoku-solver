# Sudoku Solver

## Why?
You will probably ask yourself why i wrote this code, to be honest i was bored and not satisfied with the stuff that i was doing so i surffed the net and randomly found a post on telegram that said this is the hardest sudoku every created and i was like phew not for US! then started to write the shitty code and actually learned more about how shit is python in handling arrays.

## Motive
My mom and dad, FUCKING no i hate people so i want to make them feel embaressed!
